# Capstone_Project_4

Hi, I am John Ong, and this is the jupyter notebook file I did for NTUC Learning Hub's Capstone Project 4 using Python programming language and machine learning models.

This project is regarding understanding and producing a few machine learning models to analyse the data to understand what are the more crucial factors that can cause diabetes, based on a dataset retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset contains a set of 16 features and a label, so it is ideal for supervised machine learning.

In the end, I was able to make a prediction model based on a suitable machine learning model (Random Forest), which provides a recommendation to visit the doctor for those at high risks of contracting diabetes.
